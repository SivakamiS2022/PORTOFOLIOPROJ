<p>C-drama Strong points: Story line are often more heavy and emotional, especially when the setting is in ancient time. Endings for tragedy drama are often so emotional you could cry for days, which I really like. OST are so beautiful, a lot of the time the OST are what draw people in to watch the drama, like Love and Redemption’ OST. Fantasy and traditional genre are definitely their strongest genre and are what make C-drama famous in Asia, CGI and their creativity when it comes martial art technique in the film are also unique to C-drama. Weak Points: Cliche script. Can’t really blame them when the censorship is so freaking strict in China. But like I think in the past year, I have seen dramas that are so cliche and the ending is so predictable that I abandon them halfway. Female leads and acting. I think C-drama female leads are still kind of “ Mary Sue” and there is no like “ badass” energy in them. Of course I do know that there are actress who can pull this off but in general, I think C-drama female leads are boring. And the acting omg. I know that K-Drama are not that better, but the amount of actors/actress that act sloppily nowadays are surprising. Like JJY wear heavy makeup in her drama when she is being kidnapped or when she is attending her father’s funeral, or Tiffany Tang still look pretty even if she just give birth are some of the example that show just how acting are not being taken seriously anymore. Especially Tiffany, she had been in this industry for years and still make this mistake.</p>

<p>K-drama Strong Points: Female leads. JMW, KMY, YSR and SD, are some of the most entertaining and powerful women that I have seen in dramas lately. Like they are badass, some of their personality traits are not that good, but you definitely feel like you want to be them, and that you want to be rich like them. So in term of female empowerment, K-dramas are doing great. Acting wise, K-dramas are not that better, but at the very least they don’t make stupid mistake and young actors/actress actually play their role and immerse themselves in the role. Like if they are being beaten, they are being beaten black and blue, not still remain pretty in dangerous situation. Script that are diverse. Again censorship is not that bad in Korea, as long as it not that extreme, it can probably be aired. Also the variety of scripts and ideas that K-drama have, it’s a lot. Protagonist can be problematic too but because the acting and the script is compelling, it still make the audience want to watch i.e Penthouse. Fashion. K-drama have some of the best outfits that I have seen, and even just a simple office outfit in Secretary Kim make me want to buy her whole set. Or Hotel Del Luna’ fashion are just fabulous and gorgeous.</p>
  
<p>Weak Points: Too dramatic. As much as I like Penthouse, the amount of drama and violence just make me feel tired. And it’s true for a lot of drama that focus on power struggle. Villains are evil but the violence that they committed in the film just make me wonder how had they not been caught by the government. It got boring halfway. I notice that most of the dramas are good at the beginning, but halfway through, it started to drag out and eventually it got boring. The end is often not satisfying as well because some of them doesn’t tie the loose end so it became a forced HE.</p>
